## DonorSplicer

Alternative splice site prediction is a meaningful biological question,which requires that a program finds the locations of the start codons, all the exons and introns and the stop codon for each gene. The 5' boundary or donor site of introns in most eukaryotes usually contains the dinucleotide GT and other features. Here,I present a new model named the DonorSplicer to predict Donor sites for genes in order to contribute to the solution of more accurate splice site prediction.

## Models

WAM,Bayesian network,Support vector machine

Other new models are under development.....

## To be improved

+ a complete program interface
+ parameter adjustment
+ other models
